Wow! You did read it.

There are multiple purposes for this code to have been written. So I suppose I should offer an explanation for releasing what may be "not ready for prime-time" code, the main reason for it's "release" today, is I will noze for making this code available, it’s a project that has both t be around to finish it. I am 73  years old, turn 74 in March, do you think I could find work? I can still code like this (bluetooth_control.py), but I can't find anyone to give me a job, it's still winter here, I have $2.45 in the bank and don't expect to get any money till the third. I don't see how I can make it, it was so cold last night I couldn't get to sleep till sometime after 04:30 

Anyway, enough of my problems,everyone has problems,first I apologize for bad code, well, mostly bad,it’s just Iht right now, hands are warmed by the laptop keyboard cannot think straigt due to the rest of the body, I’ll miss this project, kinda hate to end it

The primary purpose for me to write this code is for a gift to the FreeBSD community. I assume lots of folks are like me in that they enjoy using this operating system, I have have held FreeBSD close to me as my favorite operating system. But I admit, I for a long time used archlinux as my os due to the hardware support it has. But lately FreeBSD has lept forward in supporting things I use.
The only thing missing was a GUI for Bluetooth management.

In it’s current state the code will run a GUI setup /etc/bluetooth/hosts with this example of me connecting my laptop to a qdelix 5k 

98:8e:79:00:e9:43 Unnamed_Device_(98:8e:79:00:e9:43)

So one can easily modify it with the actual name to help get things working, the name part of this code is what broke me, sorry.

Some important information

    Bluetooth Management:
        For pairing, it uses hccontrol, which is commonly used on FreeBSD.
        Devices are scanned using hccontrol which is the standard for Bluetooth
management in FreeBSD.
    Audio Output:
        For audio output, PulseAudio (pactl) is used. If PulseAudio is unavailab
le, it falls back to virtual_oss, which is commonly used on FreeBSD for virtual
sound drivers.

Notes:

    This script assumes you have the FreeBSD Bluetooth stack and PulseAudio or v
irtual_oss installed and configured
    Ensure that ubt0hci is your Bluetooth interface on FreeBSD or adjust it acco
rdingly.
