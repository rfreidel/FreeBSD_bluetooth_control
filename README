This is a simple python3 script, it does require the installation of
python3, but not to worry as it can easily live along side any other 
versions you may have installed as you call it like this.

tar xvzf FreeBSD_bluetooth_control-0.1.tar.gz

then

%python3 ./bluetooth_control.py

The script should run with with pulseaudio or virtual oss, I never had luck setting up virtual_oss, so I can't really test.

    Bluetooth Management:
        For pairing, it uses hccontrol, which is commonly used on FreeBSD.
        Devices are scanned using hccontrol which is the standard for Bluetooth
management in FreeBSD.
    Audio Output:
        For audio output, PulseAudio (pactl) is used. If PulseAudio is unavailab
le, it falls back to virtual_oss, which is commonly used on FreeBSD for virtual
sound drivers.

Notes:

    This script assumes you have the FreeBSD Bluetooth stack and PulseAudio or v
irtual_oss installed.
    Ensure that ubt0hci is your Bluetooth interface on FreeBSD or adjust it acco
rdingly.
